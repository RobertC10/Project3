ABOUT THIS PROJECT
------------------------
This project is developing an application in which users will play a variation of the Dungeons & Dragons game. 
Based on a bit of modern opinions, we've examined that most 
modern games are not meeting the wants or favors of gamers all over the world, finding that "new & improved" is 
now going out of style; customers wish for a return to retro! An all out game in which they can replay as many 
times as so chosen. A game with base RNG rather than skill!
Who knows, if this game can meet the needs and wants of those in favor, others may also have the opportunity
to further develop this one into an even better RPG than ever witnessed before!
